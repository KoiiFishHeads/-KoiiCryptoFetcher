KoiiCryptoFetcher
Overview

KoiiCryptoFetcher is a Koii Network node task designed to fetch real-time cryptocurrency price data from a specified API (currently CoinGecko), process the data, and store it on the Koii blockchain. The primary goal is to provide a reliable and decentralized source of cryptocurrency market data for various applications within the Koii ecosystem.
Prerequisites

    A running Koii Network node
    Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
    A CoinGecko API key (optional, if using CoinGecko as the data source)

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/KoiiCryptoFetcher.git

    Use code with caution.

Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd KoiiCryptoFetcher

Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:
Bash

npm install

Use code with caution.

Configuration

    API Key: If using CoinGecko, create a .env file at the root of the project and add your API key as follows:

    COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_api_key

    Koii Node Configuration: Ensure your Koii node is configured correctly and running.

Running the Task

To start the KoiiCryptoFetcher task, run the following command:
Bash

node index.js

Use code with caution.
Task Logic

    Fetch Cryptocurrency Data:
        Retrieves cryptocurrency price data from the specified API.
        Handles API rate limits and errors gracefully.
    Data Processing:
        Cleans and processes the fetched data.
        Calculates relevant metrics (e.g., price change, market cap).
    Store Data on Koii Blockchain:
        Utilizes Koii Network's storage capabilities to persist the processed data.
        Considers data structure and indexing for efficient retrieval.

Task Scheduling

The task is scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every hour) to ensure up-to-date data.
Error Handling

The task includes error handling mechanisms to address API failures, network issues, and other potential problems. Retries with exponential backoff can be implemented for transient errors.
Additional Features (Optional)

    Data Validation: Implements data validation checks to ensure data integrity.
    Alert System: Sends notifications for significant price changes or other events.
    Data Visualization: Provides basic data visualization or integration with visualization tools.
    Smart Contract Integration: Interacts with smart contracts for advanced functionalities.
